# Number Generation Test Task

## Task summary

A simple React Native app with a single View and three boxes with randomly generated single-digit numbers, a "Generate" button below them that generates three new random single-digit numbers and a "Show Log" button that shows a pop-up with the history of all generated numbers.

The three displayed numbers must be stored in a Redux store.

The log must not be stored in a Redux store.

## How to build and run

Simply run `npm install` to install dependencies and you're ready to go. The app is build via React Native CLI, so make sure you have the environment set up as explained in [official instructions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) (React Native CLI section).

The app was developed with use of Xcode 11.6 and Xcode's simulator running iPhone 11.
